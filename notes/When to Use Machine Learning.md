# When to use Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is an approach to learn complex patterns from existing data and use these patterns to make predictions on unseen data.  

- __Learn__:  The system has the capacity to learn.
- __Complex Patterns__: There are paterns to learn and they are complex. 
- __Existing data__: data is available, or it's possible to collect data. 
- __Predictions__: it's a predictive problem.
- __Unseen data__: unseen data shares patterns with the training data. 
- __Repetitive__: It's a repetitive task. 
- __Cost__: The cost of wrong prediciton is cheep. 
- __Scale__: Its at scale.
- __Change__: The patterns are constantly changing.
